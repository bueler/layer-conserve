==============

Project on mass-conserving layer models with a constraint on the conserved
variable.  Includes a paper, several talks, and 1D petsc codes.

Preprint form: E. Bueler, _Conservation laws for free-boundary fluid layers_, 2020, [arxiv:2007.05625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05625)

Earlier, a nontrivial ice sheet example was moved to a [separate repo](https://github.com/bueler/sia-fve) and published.
