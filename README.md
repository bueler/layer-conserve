layer-conserve
==============

This is a project on mass-conserving layer models, especially with climate applications such as ice sheets, sea ice, subglacial water, shallow water, etc., with a nonnegativity constraint on the conserved thickness variable.  This repository includes a paper, several talks, and 1D petsc codes.

The paper was submitted to SIAM J. Applied Math., and is available in preprint form:

  * E. Bueler (2020). _Conservation laws for free-boundary fluid layers_, [arxiv:2007.05625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05625)

A nontrivial ice sheet example was moved to a [separate repo](https://github.com/bueler/sia-fve) and published:

  * E. Bueler (2016).  _Stable finite volume element schemes for the shallow-ice approximation_, J. Glaciol. 62 (232), 230-242, [doi:10.1017/jog.2015.3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2015.3)
